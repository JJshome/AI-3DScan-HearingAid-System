# AI-Enhanced 3D Scanning Hearing Aid Manufacturing System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation details for a novel rapid customized hearing aid manufacturing system that leverages artificial intelligence, 3D scanning technology, and large language models to revolutionize the hearing aid production process. The system addresses critical limitations in traditional hearing aid manufacturing, including discomfort during ear impression taking, long production times, poor fit, acoustic feedback issues, and limited personalization.

## System Architecture

The system consists of several integrated modules that work together to create a seamless manufacturing pipeline:

1. **3D Scanning Module (100)**: High-precision scanning of the ear canal without invasive ear impressions
2. **AI Design Module (200)**: Automated, personalized hearing aid shell design using machine learning
3. **3D Printing Module (300)**: Rapid prototyping of hearing aid shells with biocompatible materials
4. **Acoustic Optimization Module (400)**: AI-driven acoustic simulation and performance optimization
5. **IoT Monitoring Module (500)**: Real-time performance tracking and adjustment capabilities
6. **Integration Control System (600)**: Central system coordinating all modules
7. **LLM Integration Module (700)**: Advanced user interface with natural language processing
8. **Rapid Fitting Module (800)**: Streamlined fitting process for immediate use
